The mushroom has a large, rounded, light blue cap with a few white spots, typical of a mushroom's appearance. The cap is slightly curved and has a smooth texture. The body of the mushroom is a smooth, off-white color, giving it a soft, almost porcelain-like appearance. 

The mushroom has two small, rounded arms with a simple, rounded shape, and a single, small, round eye with a black dot in the center, giving it a cheerful, innocent expression. Its mouth is open in a wide, joyful smile, revealing a small, white tongue. 

The mushroom stands on two short, stubby legs with yellow, rounded shoes, adding a touch of whimsy to its appearance. The shoes have a simple, rounded shape and are slightly larger than the legs, giving the character a playful, cartoonish look.

The background is a solid black, making the mushroom stand out prominently with its vibrant blue cap and contrasting white body. The overall style of the character is whimsical and cartoonish, with a focus on simplicity and bright, cheerful colors. The texture of the mushroom's body and cap appears smooth and slightly glossy, enhancing the cute and playful aesthetic.
